# Net64 Client (unofficial) (WIP)

This is a modified client for Net64 aka Sm64O, that uses the Websocket protocol.

## Why?

Because the official client uses the [Hazel protocol](https://github.com/DarkRiftNetworking/Hazel-Networking) and I want to make a dedicated server with Node.js.
The Hazel protocol is only implemented in C# and honestly, noone uses it (sorry).

With this client you won't be able to connect to any official server. You can only connect to servers, that use my [dedicated server software](https://github.com/Tarnadas/sm64o-ded). You also won't be able to create a server with this client.

If you want to get the original client, please go [here](https://github.com/Guad/sm64o). If you only want to play with friends, the official client is a better choice.
